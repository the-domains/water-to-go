### Expense Saving & Helping the Environment

My Explore travel group to China was advised that we should always drink bottled water rather than tap water and thus the rest of the group were forever searching for relevant shops, or carrying several weighty bottles around with them. Personally I always used my Water-to-go bottle, and refilled it as necessary at the taps in hotel rooms, restaurants or public toilets and also in mountain streams, when we were on our trek. I thus certainly saved on expense, as well as feeling much happier that I was not responsible for damaging the environment.

### Best Choice I Ever Made!

After searching through different water purification bottles on the Internet and finally settling on Water-to-go, I was still doubtful. I needed it for a 3 month trip to Tanzania volunteering with Restless Development and went for the GO! bottle. Best choice I have ever made! Not only has it saved me a lot of money but it's meant that I've stayed very hydrated wherever I've been as I can fill it up from taps, and eventually, after gathering enough faith in the filter, from wells. It filters the water and then some, leaving you with great tasting clean water! It caused a lot of jealously among the group with everyone wanting to know where I got it from, and when there was a shortage of clean bottled water people, knew where to go for hydration. Not only is the product itself great but with 'watertogo' I've easily experienced the best customer service in a long time with very quick, friendly responses to every query. Anyone in doubt like I was 3 months ago, forgot the doubts and buy one. You won't regret it.
